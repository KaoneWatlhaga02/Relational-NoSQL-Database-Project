# Relational-NoSQL-Database-Project

## Overview  
This project demonstrates designing and implementing both relational and NoSQL databases using **PostgreSQL** and **MongoDB**. It highlights effective schema design, data integrity, and CRUD operations for managing structured and semi-structured data in business scenarios.

## Features  
- **PostgreSQL:**  
  - Normalized relational schemas with tables and relationships  
  - CRUD operations via SQL queries  
  - Data integrity with constraints and indexes  
  - Implementation script: `adt_postgresql.sql`

- **MongoDB:**  
  - Flexible document-based schemas for unstructured data  
  - CRUD operations using MongoDB Query Language  
  - Schema design optimized for performance and scalability  
  - Implementation script: `final_adt.js`

## Use Case  
Supports managing diverse data types and querying needs within simulated business applications by leveraging both database models.

## Technologies  
- PostgreSQL  
- MongoDB  
- SQL
